						<h4>4m-10m</h4>

					<p>In this class, children ages 4 to 10 months learn how to crawl through tunnels, ride on cool toys, do thumb pull-ups, manipulate objects, and follow along with songs. In the development of these skills, understanding of speech improves and a sense of trust starts to develop. Squeakers also start gaining a better awareness of things around them and begin understanding cause/effect.
