				<h2 class="section-title">Unique curriculum</h2>
				<p>Even though our program is remarkably fun and engaging, our unique curriculum is developed utilizing International standards of Mathematics, Science, and Literacy. Classes are scheduled one hour per week for a duration of 20 weeks. This format allows for the possibility of a student being enrolled in one, or multiple, classes at a time. Additionally, these classes can be offered as 5 day, three hour per day camps.</p>
